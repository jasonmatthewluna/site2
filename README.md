## üïäÔ∏è About the Project

I've had this re-design in my back pocket for a bit, and even created the home page (sans nav bar) early last year. Now that I have some time from working from home rather than half in-person, I've rebooted it with some new plans for the site.

Rather than it's initial research-oriented focus, it's now centered on my writing in all forms (casual and more serious). Both my writing and the site (i.e. my web development skills) will grow together as I maintain it!

Take a look at the Figma file following the evolution of the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/vesqIc54LnZiE07MLjRzAn/Website?node-id=0%3A1).

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Incoming Changes

1.  **Functional Blog**

    Use Gatsby and MDX to port over the writing from my previous site (see: jasonmatthewluna.github.io) and the drafts that have been hidden away on my computer for quite some time so they can live here!

2.  **Friends List**

    I saw a cute tweet (will look for source later) linking to friends' sites and activities and giving little blurbs on why they should be hired. Since this site is semi-professional, it'd be nice to feature some of the friends who have both helped make the site and helped make me.

3.  **Twitter Feed**

    I'm scared to tweet. Honestly, in general, I'm scared of having personal social media accounts.  When it came to marketing and using the company accounts, I had no worries, but building my own brand and connecting it to me has always been a problem. Having some of those thoughts I would post on Twitter featured on my site makes sense and is a good step to overcoming the lack of confidence in posting online.

4. **Responsive Design**

    Any site mainly meant for reading should be consumable on all device types and screens.

## üåô Stretch Goals

1.  **Wallpapers**

    In designing these cute Super Mario Sunshine-inspired emojis that represent my name, I also created a bunch of different "wallpapers" that could be used as the background of my site. In the future, these should be visible and be able to be toggled on the homepage.

2. **Animations & Easter Eggs**

    They wouldn't be easter eggs if I told you about them, right?
