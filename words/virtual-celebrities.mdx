The world is no stranger to virtual idols: In the early 2010s, Hatsune Miku, a software voicebank known as a Vocaloid, started to gain popularity with her trademark cyan twintails and anime look.

Westerners dismissed the idea of an augmented reality idol as silly, though the franchise, by 2012 after 5 years in release, would earn 10 billion yen (~95 million USD).

Now, the Western world is no stranger to augmented reality and virtual reality.

While mainstream western culture might still find the digital idol to be on the fringe, the concept has been gaining popularity on mainstream platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and gaming at large.

VTubers (Virtual YouTubers) specifically have found renown. These streamers and content producers use a 3D digital avatar, usually anime-inspired in design, to entertain online audiences. The trend started with Kizuna AI in Japan in 2016, but has since spread to other communities.

The prevalence of VTubers has led to an industry made for managing and promoting VTuber talent, such as Hololive, which features an English, Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesian cast.

Popular Twitch streamers like Pokimane and Lilypichu have also co-opted using a VTuber model for times when they would prefer to stream without a camera. These models were commissioned to artists and cost at minimum in the low thousands of dollars.

While there has been some controversy over gatekeeping the pair from the VTuber community, the two do seem to be appreciative of VTuber culture as a whole and have expressed that they have no plans to become VTubers. Instead, the virtual model is an escape from toxicity in online streaming culture as a whole as it relates to appearance.

Returning to the concept of virtual celebrity though, it's interesting how Riot Games, an outsider to K-Pop, might just be the inspiration for Aespa, a group debuting from one of the Korean pop music industry's biggest companies.

There isn't anything conclusive pointing to the link though.

SM Entertainment has a history of diversifying its portfolio, and their forays into making their idols more accessible are nothing new. From virtual assistants to morning alarms with idol's voices and other technologies, SM has done it all.

What will be interesting to see is how the company plans to manage and commercialize the digital counterparts.

According to current promotions, fans will be able to interact with chatbots for each virtual idol at any point in time.

We have no frame of reference for how this is done, whether the personality will be based on the in-person idol the avatar mirrors or whether the chatbot learns from ongoing conversations.

To some of the more observant fans, it might sound creepy, as if the company plans to replace their idols with a virtual mask.

To some extent, this might be true.

With K/DA, Riot Games has featured a rotating cast of performers to perform behind the mask of their characters, all in order to sell an in-game skin line.

SM Entertainment manages another group, NCT, whose concept is a rotating cast of idols a la Japanese group AKB48, where new members can become part of a group at any moment. This concept has largely changed to feature more fixed casts though.

NCT Dream, which originally served as an introduction for younger members, lost its graduation model, where, upon coming of age, a member would graduate out of the group. Only NCT U continues to keep a rotating cast of members, though that's in line with SM's original goals to use the subunit to promote the members of other standardized groups.

With Aespa, it seems unlikely that the four women set to debut will be replaced by other voices, especially when they come as the main attraction for fans who might be interested in interacting with the group's virtual counterparts.

But, no matter how SM Entertainment plans to market the VTubers, it'll be interesting to see how the group is received globally.

As SM Entertainment, along with other top companies, continues to look for a way to emulate BTS and Bighit's success with western audiences, it's possible they believe they have found a winning formula by following Riot Games' footsteps, even though Riot Games' target was Korean and Chinese e-Sports communities. Though the more likely case is that they've simply found a novel way to embed themselves in the lives of fans for further commercialization.
